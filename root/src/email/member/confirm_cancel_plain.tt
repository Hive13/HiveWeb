Hello [% member.fname %],

We've noticed your PayPal subscription has been cancelled.  If this is intentional, please visit [% base_url _ 'member/cancel' %] to confirm.

If this is not intentional, don't worry.  This sometimes happens due to issues such as a credit card expiring.  If you need to re-subscribe, just visit [% base_url _ 'member/pay' %] and you'll see the subscribe button.

Thank you,
intweb
