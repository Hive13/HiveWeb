Our Discourse is our official means of communicating amongst ourselves and is where any votes will be posted.You should sign up for it at https://discourse.hive13.org/
You should also be receiving an invite to our Slack channel https://hive13.slack.com shortly. Slack is for casual messaging amongst Hive13 and general questions. You will get the fastest response for any question via Slack.

If you have any questions on general housekeeping (making parking tags, taking out the trash, etc.), check out our library of Hive1-2-3s for basic guides on daily life in our space.

This is a lot of information all at once. As Douglas Adams once wrote: DON'T PANIC! You just joined a community of over 200 likeminded individuals to learn from, create with, and enjoy. We can't wait to see what you'll make. 

Once again, Welcome to Hive13 from all of us.
